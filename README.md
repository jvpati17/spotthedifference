Game Title: Spot The Difference

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Intro

A silly little single-player game meant to challenge its users physically, emotionally and visually.

Challenge 

Spot any differences to lead to next round, watch player score go up as player passes these challenges.

Game Functionality

-Per round, player will be presented a unique board with one difference

-If player clicks correctly, player will be presented with an option to continue game via 'next round' button 

-Click incorrectly and player is presented with a 'wrong answer' message and a 'play again' button which will direct back to the home screen

Future Plans

-win/lose score logic; allow player to continue through rounds whether they pass or fail board (make score board interactive)
-orangize board cell per cell vs winning cell/losing cell(s)
